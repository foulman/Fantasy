      "When casting a spell; any spell, make sure you have everything you need to cast it. Some don't take as long, and are good when you need their effects fast, or don't have time for a long ritual.",
      "Don't try casting long rituals in the thick of combat. Not only will the enermy attack you, but you can't defend yourself when doing that. I hear evocation magic is rather fast, though.",
